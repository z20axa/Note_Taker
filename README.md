# Note Taker (Express.js)

## App description

- This a modified starter code creating an application called Note Taker that can be used to write, save, and delete notes. This application use an Express.js back end and save and retrieve note data from a JSON file.

- The application’s front end was already been created. My job was to build the back end, connect the two, and then deploy the entire application to Heroku.
